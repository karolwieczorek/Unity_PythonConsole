## About
It's simple python console based on IronPython.net
You can pretty much execute any command, 
method, change variables, create objects 
all in play mode

## Running

It could work on older Unity versions 
but it wasn't tested

To test in editor just open scene 
```sh
Assets/Scenes/main.unity 
```
and hit play.

## Builds:

WebGL is not working as far as I know
other platforms not tested yet
